			<p> 


				I have a big heart for helping and teaching others what I already know. I usually try
				to make that clear in a positive and confident way.<br>
				The other passion that runs 
				through my is fitness and living a healthy life.<br>
				Maintaining a balanced mind, body, and 
				soul.<br>
				Most importantly my heart is mainly focused on my self growth and being able to support myself and ones I love.<br>
				With my passion combined my set skills such as positivity, confidence, discipline, open-mindless and hard working, has pointed me into a well thought out career that is currently growing by 10-14 percent in the tech industry.<br>
				I have decided to gear my hustle, which is my heart and head working together, towards becoming a web developer.<br>
				Like a full stack developer or iOS developer or even a project manager.<br>
				My hustle will definitely get me through this 8 week pre-training course and through the 6 month program at General Assembly.<br>
				I have a goal and I will achieve my goal so that I can be happy, healthy and loving.
